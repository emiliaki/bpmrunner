      <h1><b>Love-Letter Rulebook</b></h1>
      <h2>How to Play (2 to 4 Players)</h2>
        <p>
            Love Letter is played in a series of rounds. Each round represents one day. At the end of each round, one player’s letter
            reaches Princess Annette, and she reads it. When she reads enough letters from one suitor, she becomes enamored and
            grants that suitor permission to court her. That player wins the Princess’ heart and the game. 
          </p>
      <h2>Taking A Turn</h2>
      <p>
        On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then, choose one of the two cards now in
        your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply any effect on the card you discarded. You must apply its effect,
        even if it is bad for you!
        See page 8 for the effects of each individual card. If you have any questions about special cases regarding the card,
        you’ll find the answer there.
        All discarded cards remain in front of the player who discarded them. Overlap the cards so that it’s clear in which
        order they were discarded. This helps players to figure out which cards other players might be holding.
        Once you finish applying the card’s effect, the turn passes to the player on your left.
      </p>
      <h2>Out of the Round</h2>
      <p> If a player is knocked out of the round, that player discards the card in his or her hand face up (but does not apply the
      card’s effect) and takes no more turns until the next round. </p>

      <div class="center1">
        <p>Meet the people from the game: </p>
        <div>
          <h2>Princess</h2>
          <p>Hampered only by the naïveté of youth, Princess Annette is elegant, charming, and beautiful. Obviously, you want the
          princess to carry your letter. However, she is self-conscious about matters of the heart, and if confronted, will toss your letter
          in the fire and deny looking at any correspondence.</p>
          <p>
          If you discard the Princess—no matter how or why—she has tossed your letter into the fire. You are immediately
          knocked out of the round. If the Princess was discarded by a card effect, any remaining effects of that card do not
          apply (you do not draw a card from the Prince, for example). Effects tied to being knocked out the round still apply
          (eg. Constable, Jester), however.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Countess</h2>
          <p>
            Always on the prowl for a handsome man or juicy gossip, Wilhelmina’s age and noble blood make her one of Princess Annette’s
            friends. While she has great influence over the Princess, she makes herself scarce whenever the King or Prince are around.
            Unlike other cards, which take effect when discarded, the text on the Countess applies while she is in your hand. In
            fact, the only time it doesn’t apply is when you discard her. </p>
            <p>
            If you ever have the Countess and either the King or Prince in your hand, you must discard the Countess. You do
            not have to reveal the other card in your hand. Of course, you can also discard the Countess even if you do not have a
            royal family member in your hand. The Countess likes to play mind games....
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>King</h2>
          <p>
            The undisputed ruler of Tempest… for the moment. Because of his role in the arrest of Queen Marianna, he does not rate as
            highly with Princess Annette as a father should. He hopes to work himself back into her graces.</p>
            <p>
            When you discard King Arnaud IV, trade the card in your hand with the card held by another player of your choice.
            You cannot trade with a player who is out of the round.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Prince</h2>
          <p>
            As a social gadfly, Prince Arnaud was not as distressed over his mother’s arrest as one would suppose. Since many women
            clamor for his attention, he hopes to help his sister find the same banal happiness by playing matchmaker. </p>
            <p>
            When you discard Prince Arnaud, choose one player still in the round (including yourself). That player discards his or
            her hand (but doesn’t apply its effect, unless it is the Princess, see page 8) and draws a new one. If the deck is empty
            and the player cannot draw a card, that player draws the card that was removed at the start of the round. If all other
            players are protected by the Handmaid, you must choose yourself.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Handmaid</h2>
          <p>
            Few would trust a mere Handmaid with a letter of importance. Fewer still understand Susannah’s cleverness, or her skilled 
            ability at playing the foolish Handmaid. That the Queen’s confidante and loyal servant escaped any attention after the
            Queen’s arrest is a testament to her clever mind. </p>
            <p>
            When you discard the Handmaid, you are immune to the effects of other players’ cards until the start of your next
            turn. If all players other than the player whose turn it is are protected by the Handmaid, the player must choose himor herself for a card’s effects, if possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Baron</h2>
          <p>
            The scion of an esteemed house that has long been a close ally of the royal family, Baron Talus has a quiet and gentle demeanor
            that conceals a man used to being obeyed. His suggestions are often treated as if they came from the King himself. </p>
            <p>
            When you discard the Baron, choose another player still in the round. You and that player secretly
            compare your hands. The player with the lower number is knocked out of the round. In case of a tie, nothing happens.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Priest</h2>
          <p>
            Open, honest, and uplifting, Father Tomas always seeks out the opportunity to do good. With
            the arrest of the Queen, he is often seen about the palace, acting as confessor, counselor, and
            friend. </p>
            <p>
            When you discard the Priest, you can look at another player’s hand. Do not reveal the
            hand to any other players.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Guard</h2>
          <p>
            Charged with seeing to the security of the royal family, Odette follows her orders with
            persistence and diligence… even though her mentor is said to have drowned while fleeing
            arrest for complicity in the Queen’s treason. </p>
            <p>
            When you discard the Guard, choose a player and name a number (other than 1). If
            that player has that number in their hand, that player is knocked out of the round.
            If all other players still in the round cannot be chosen (eg. due to Handmaid or
            Sycophant), this card is discarded without effect.
